 Archeologists measured the height and the base side of the pyramid to be 150 and 200 meters long.
 Your task is to help them compute the volume of the pyramid using the following formulas:
 Volume = (Base Area * Height) / 3 
 and Base Area = BaseSide^2
 */
// BaseSide= = 200^2 = 40,000
public class pyramidVolume {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.print((40000 * 150)/3);
    }
}
